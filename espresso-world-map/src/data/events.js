https://x.com/kisaguncan/status/1882536773609541961

​Our goal is to explore how synchronous composability can be achieved within the context of based sequencing. We’ll whiteboard potential solutions for a gateway-enabled based sequencing world, using cross-chain use cases like swaps and liquidity aggregation as reference points.

This is going to be a small session. We would like to curate a group of researchers, L2 builders, block builders, gateway/preconf. builders, cross-chain applications and bridges/solvers in the room.

If there's a use-case you'd like to present or discuss, please submit ahead of time.

Light bites & soft drinks will be provided to keep us fueled for an exciting conversation about the future of Ethereum!`,

​현장에서: 신선한 커피 한 잔을 즐기고 최신 굿즈도 받아가고 퍼스널 컬러 진단 체험도 하고 Espresso 브랜딩 포토도 남기고 블라인드 박스를 직접 오픈하는 재미까지!

Wrap up your KBW experience with a lively karaoke night, hosted by Espresso and CoinEasy. Bring your best vocals (or just your best energy) and get ready for good vibes, big laughs, and maybe even a surprise duet or two.

​In need of a little liquid courage? Don't worry, we’ve got you covered. 🍹 And don’t miss out on the exclusive swag, only available at this event!

​P.S. We promise “Espresso” by Sabrina Carpenter won’t be on repeat. Pinky promise.

More details coming soon!

​서울 와서 노래방 안 가면 섭하죠? 🎤

​KBW 마무리는 Espresso랑 CoinEasy가 준비한 찐 노래방 파티에서! 노래 잘 부를 필요 전혀 없습니다, 그냥 텐션만 챙겨오면 돼요. 웃음 빵빵, 깜짝 듀엣도 터질 수 있습니다.

​목 좀 풀어줄 용기가 필요하다면? 저희가 준비한 드링크가 기다리고 있으니까 걱정 NO 🍹 그리고 이 밤에만 받을 수 있는 한정 굿즈도 있으니 놓치지 마세요!

​P.S. 사브리나 카펜터의 〈Espresso〉무한 반복 안 합니다. 진짜예요. 핑키 프로미스!`,
